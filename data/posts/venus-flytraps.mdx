## Introduction

A truly unique and captivating plant, boasting vibrant green and red jaws that snap shut on unsuspecting prey. The Venus flytrap rightfully earned its name by chomping down on flies and other insects alike.

In this article, I will discuss everything you need to know about Venus flytraps, from their fascinating trap mechanisms to the many variations of plants, where they naturally grow, and how to care for one in your own home.

## Dionaea? Can you say that again?

Before we dive in, it's worth understanding how the scientific naming system for plants works, it will serve you well as you learn more about carnivorous plants. Refer to the picture below, the species of Venus flytrap depicted is named Dionaea muscipula, or more commonly just Venus flytrap.

All Venus flytraps belong to the genus Dionaea. To be even more specific, Dionaea is a monotypic genus meaning there is only one kind of species within that genus, Dionaea muscipula, the Venus flytrap. This is sort of confusing but just remember, the Venus flytrap is so unique it's the only species in its genus!

## The Varieties of Venus Flytraps

Despite only having a single species, there's actually a fascinating variety of cultivars out there, each with its own unique features. This is much different compared to the Sundew for example, which is the largest part of the same family Droseraceae with almost 200 different species!

Think of a cultivar like a breed of dog, there are big dogs, small dogs, fluffy dogs, and short-haired dogs, but they are all still dogs! So when we are talking about a cultivar, we are referencing the same species of plant, they just may boast some different characteristics. Let's take a closer look!

### Typical Venus Flytraps

When people think of Venus flytraps, they often imagine the "typical" variety. These plants are what you'd expect – green with a red inner trap and spiny teeth awaiting to seal its future prey away.

### Giant Venus Flytraps

Known as 'B52' or 'DC XL,' these Venus flytraps have traps that can grow up to two inches long. They're larger, more robust, and tend to capture more significant prey.

### Red Venus Flytraps

Cultivars like 'Akai Ryu' (Japanese for Red Dragon) or 'Maroon Monster' are unique because they exhibit an intense red or maroon coloration throughout the plant, including the traps, making them quite eye-catching and very popular!

### Sawtooth Venus Flytraps

As the name suggests, these Venus flytraps have triangular and jagged or serrated traps! They also come in a variety of colors depending on the cultivar, with a more typical coloring in the Dionaea 'Dentata' and a red coloring in Dionaea 'Red Piranha.'

### Warped Trap Venus Flytraps

It can be hard to classify the different groups of Venus flytrap cultivars, I figured it is fair to classify these as warped. In these Venus flytraps you will find the typical shape is warped in some way, for example, the 'Cupped Trap' below has a cupped trap. While the 'Mirror' cultivar has some traps growing out of the side of the main trap. There are also warped cultivars that completely inhibit the plant's ability to catch prey!

## The Carnivorous Existence of Venus Flytraps

The key characteristic of a Venus flytrap is of course its trapping mechanism. Inside each of its jaws, there are thin trigger hairs that, when touched or bent, send a signal to the trap to snap shut, ensnaring its prey.

Why go to all this trouble with trigger hairs and moving traps? Why not simply draw nutrients from the soil, like regular plants? The reality is that Venus flytraps have evolved in nutrient-poor soils and have adapted to supplement their nutritional needs by catching unfortunate insects!

## A Beginner's Guide to Growing Venus Flytraps

When I was a kid I saw a really cool looking plant at the store, it was a Venus flytrap! My mom was gracious and bought it for me. I was too young to really understand how I should research how to take care of it, so all I did was water it with tap water and hope for the best.

Surprise, surprise, my plant died! As I got older I remembered that experience, and like many people, began to believe that carnivorous plants were very difficult to take care of.

This is a really common misconception. In fact, with a few key bits of knowledge and some patience, you can surprisingly easily grow and care for a healthy Venus flytrap!

### Sunlight

Like most carnivorous plants, Venus flytraps really love sunlight!

Don't let the spooky, shadowy marshlands where Venus flytraps are found in nature fool you – these locations receive a lot of sun. Venus flytraps generally need a minimum of 4-6 hours of direct sunlight each day. A sunny windowsill will suffice, or if weather conditions permit, they can also thrive outdoors.

### Water

Similar to other carnivorous plants, Venus flytraps prefer water that's free of minerals, which means distilled water, reverse osmosis (RO) water, or rainwater. Tap water or mineral water will harm your plant over time as the soil will begin to be diluted with minerals, which they are not equipped to handle.

A very easy way to keep your plant hydrated is to have a pot with a hole in the bottom and place it into a tray. Fill the tray up with a half-inch to an inch of distilled water and you are good for a few days! Your soil will stay saturated with the perfect amount of water, just like the bogs in the wild!

### Soil

When it comes to soil, you want to avoid any enriched or fertilized potting soil. Just like they prefer mineral-free water, Venus flytraps thrive in nutrient-poor soil. A mixture of sphagnum peat moss and sand or perlite usually works well. You can find carnivorous plant mix from many reputable sources online!

With that being said, if you bought your plant from a reliable source, you shouldn't have to worry about repotting it right away and it will be in the proper soil!

## A Quick Recap: Essential Facts about Venus Flytraps

To wrap up, here are the key points that were covered about Venus flytraps:

- All Venus flytraps fall under the genus Dionaea. Dionaea is considered a monotypic genus, where its only species is Dionaea muscipula. So when you see a plant referred to as Dionaea OR Dionaea muscipula, you're looking at the one and only Venus flytrap every time!
- While the common image of a Venus flytrap is the "typical" variety, there are many fascinating cultivars, each with unique characteristics. Some of these varieties sport deep reds and maroons, extra large traps, jagged serrated teeth, or even warped or fused trap shapes!
- Venus flytraps have evolved to be carnivorous to compensate for nutrient-deficient soils. Their trapping mechanism helps them capture and digest insects to make up for that nutrient deficiency!
- Contrary to popular belief, Venus flytraps are not overly difficult to care for as long as you provide them with plenty of sunlight, the proper soil, and mineral-free water!
